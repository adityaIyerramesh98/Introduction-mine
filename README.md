## _About Me_
A Chemical Engineer turned Data-Science Engineer (Intern). My journey has waltzed me through various fields, and I passionately value about integrating my knowledge in Chemical Engineering with Data Science to troubleshoot and paving remedies to complex problems.

## _Fields of Interest_
- Aero-thermal Sciences
- Computational Engineering
- Backend Web Development
- ML Ops
- Process Engineering

## _Languages Adept in_
- Python
- C
- C++
- Julia

## _Currently Learning_
- Java
- JavaScript

## _Thermal + CFD Software Packages_
I primarily use **OpenFoam** for most of my requirements, but I also utilize **Matlab** and **ANSYS** for efficient pre and post processing of models.

## _Frameworks I Use_
- **NumPy** and **Pandas** (for Python)
- **Django** (for Python builds)
- **TensorFlow** and **Scikit-Learn** (majorly for MLOps and Data Science projects)
- Currently learning **Node.js** and **Express.js** to integrate with JavaScript for future projects.

## _Process Tools_ (Core Domain)
- **Aspen V11**
- **HYSYS**
- **AVEVA Pro**
- **DWSIM** (for backend checks)

## _Long-Term_
I am eager to assimilate and broaden my horizons in the fields entailing but not limited to Aero-thermal Sciences, Thermal-Flow Engineering, Web Development, and Machine Learning.
