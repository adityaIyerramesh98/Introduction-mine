# Hey Everyone, This is Aditya Iyer Ramesh! 

I know that sounds like a pretty strechy name, but yeah you can call me "Aditya".

Before you know more about me, If you're a coffeeholic, then welcome to my club of "coffeestreakers"! I love'em.

These are some of my _foibles_ A.k.a. (**purest coincidences**) y'all would like to know of me, but yeah it's blatant enough to portray my existence in this quirky forum, If not so for some code :) 

I'm an Undergrad (**Class of 2020**) who did the _Three Indian Mistakes_ 😅

 😁  Was good at studies (Not great thou)! 

 😁 Did decent math, apart from regression, calculus and combinatorics everything scattered my attention, and somehow I found a path to converge it into _Physics_ and _Chemistry_ 😅 ("**Bonds**", yeah that's what I'm talkin' about)! 

 😁 After giving the most coveted AISSCE, I too opted for doing the "Jugaad" (_translation: figuring out something out of nothing_) with machines, but this time there was a process involved, so yeah basically "**Chemical Engineering**" was what I worked my ass of for a quarter of a decade !! 

After perceiving such blunders, I thought of deviating my attention onto something which involved programming and computations, that's where I learned about MATLAB and CFD. Now, I deal with them so often, I forget to check on my friends. 

Talking about my LTCG (_abbr_: **Long-term-Career-Goals**) I had admits from univeristies thou, but I deferred'em, in regard to explore a bit more in these fields: 

  💡 CFD 

  💡 Reacting Flows (Chemical) 

  💡 Compressible and Incompressible Flows 

  💡 Computational Nanotechnology and,

  💡 Nanofluids Simulations. 

So that pursuit persuaded me to think of applying for Doctoral Studies this upcoming Fall (That's for 2022) in the field of **Chemical Engineering** specialising in **Computational Sciences**. I'll keep updating this "readme" as and when I broaden my horizon and transcend my expertise in the said fields.

**A Quick Update**: An separate _site hosting_ is in the pipeline. I'll paste the URL here, as soon as I conclude that.
