# Hello There 👋🏼 

This is Aditya Iyer Ramesh, I know that sounds like a pretty strechy name, but yeah you can call me **"Aditya"**!!

Am a **ChemE Undergrad** and my _current research_ involves areas pertinent to: 

  💡 **Computational Nanotechnology, Effect of Nanofluids inside HXs using ANSYS.**

  💡 **Turbulence Reacting and Shear Flows (Turbulence Modelling), Multiphase Flows and High Schmidt Number Scalar Mixing.**   
 
  💡 **Compressible Flows, Gas-Liquid Flows, Gas-Particle Flows and Subsonic and Supersonic Noise Simulations (A Retrospective Analysis).** 
  
  💡 **MD Simulations using KMC Method, Chemical Reaction Engineering and Kinetic Theory.**
  
  💡 **LES and DNS with low mach and reynold numbers including small scales, FEA using Fluid Mechanics.** 
  
Possessing good working knowledge on wet research with utilization of Softwares and Packages including:

  💡 **MATLAB**,**Python**, **C**, **C++** _and_ **Runtime Environments** like **Linux Bash**, **Ubuntu**, **Java** _and_ **GIT Bash**. 
  
  💡 **OpenFOAM**, **ANSYS Workbench**, **ANSYS Fluent**, **ANSYS Mechanical** for _Pre-Processing_ and **CFD-Post**, **Paraview** for _Post-Processing_ of _Simulations_.
  
  💡 **OriginPro** _and_ **Aspen Hysys Plus V11.0** _for_ **Data Processing** _and_ **PFD Designing**.
  
Learning HPC and ML Packages which would be implemented in due course of time, entails:

  💡 **OpenMPI**, **CUDA (GPU)** _and_ **Massively Parallel Computations** _(Falling short of a SP, ready for intern)_
  
  💡 **SciML**, **Deep Learning (DL)**, **Convolution Neural Networks (CNNs)**, **Physics Informed Neural Networks (PINNs)**, **Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)**, **Variational Auto Encoders (VAEs)** _and_ **Bayesian Statistics**.
  
  💡 **Deep Text Mining** for creating up a _linked database_ to store _research articles, arXiv publications_ and _citational articles_.  

**QUICK UPDATE:** A separate _site hosting_ (portfolio) is in the pipeline. I'll paste the URL here, as soon as I build that and automate the same using git clones.
