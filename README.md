# Hey Everyone, This is Aditya Iyer Ramesh 👋🏼 

I know that sounds like a pretty strechy name, but yeah you can call me **"Aditya"**!!

Am a ChemE Undergrad and My LTCG (_abbr_: **Long-Term-Career-Goals**), would tentatively be to march on pursuing a doctorate in fields pertinent to: 

  💡 Computational Nanotechnology, Effect of Nanofluids inside HX using ANSYS.

  💡 Turbulence Reacting Flows (Turbulence Modelling) and Multiphase Flows.
 
  💡 Compressible Flows, Gas-Liquid Flows, Gas-Particle Flows and Subsonic and Supersonic Noise Simulations (A Retrospective Analysis). 
  
  💡 MD Simulations using MC Method, Chemical Reaction Engineering and Kinetic Theory.
  
  💡 LES and DNS with low mach numbers, FEA using Fluid Mechanics. 
  
Possessing good working knowledge on wet research with utilization of softwares and equipments including:

  💡 MATLAB, Python, C, C++ and Runtime Environments like Linux, Ubuntu and Java.
  
  💡 OpenFOAM, ANSYS Workbench, ANSYS Fluent, ANSYS Mechanical for Pre-Processing and CFD-Post, Paraview for Post-Processing.
  
  💡 Currently learing Julia, Cantera, OpenMPI and SciML for modularizing my codes. 
  
  💡 OriginPro and Aspen Hysys Plus V11.0 for Data Processing and PFD Designing.


**QUICK UPDATE:** A separate _site hosting_ (portfolio) is in the pipeline. I'll paste the URL here, as soon as I build that and automate the same using git clones.
