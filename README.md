# Hey Everyone, This is Aditya Iyer Ramesh 👋🏼 

I know that sounds like a pretty strechy name, but yeah you can call me **"Aditya"**.

Before you know more about me, If you're a coffeeholic, then welcome to my club of **"coffeestreakers"**!!

There are some _foibles_ A.k.a. (**purest coincidences**) I'd like y'all to know of me, but yeah it's blatant enough to portray my preconcieved existence in this geeky forum, If not so for some code :) 

I'm that Quirky Indian (**UG Class of 2020**) who did the _Three Indian Mistakes_ 😅;

 😁 Did decent at studies (Not great thou)! 

 😁 Did decent math, apart from regression, calculus and combinatorics everything scattered my attention, and somehow I found a path to converge it into _QP, QM_ and _Analytical Chemistry_ 😅 ("**Bonds**", yeah that's what I'm talkin' about)! 

 😁 On giving the most coveted **AISSCE**, I too opted for doing the _"Jugaad"_ (**translation**: _figuring out something out of nothing_) with machines, with a process involved, so yeah basically "**Chemical Engineering**" was what I worked my ass of for a quarter of a decade !! 

After perceiving such blunders, I thought of deviating my attention onto something which involved programming and computations as since childhood computers amused me to the same extent as cartoons did, so that's where I learned about many coding languages let alone C, C++, MATLAB, Python, Julia, Cantera _et cetera_. Now, I deal with them so often, that I slip to check on my friends. 

Talking about my LTCG (_abbr_: **Long-Term-Career-Goals**), I would march on pursuing a doctorate in fields pertinent to: 

  💡 Simulating Nanofluids which potentially diverges the area of Computational Nanotechnology.
  
  💡 CFD (LES and DNS, both with low mach numbers to attain faster computation times and higher computational efficiency). 

  💡 Chemically Reacting Flows and Reacting Gas Dynamics. 

  💡 Compressible/Incompressible Flows, Subsonic and Supersonic Noise Simulations (A Retrospective Analysis).  

I'll keep updating my "handout" as and when I broaden my horizon and transcend my expertise in the said fields.

**QUICK UPDATE:** A separate _site hosting_ (portfolio) is in the pipeline. I'll paste the URL here, as soon as I build that.
