# Hello There 👋🏼 

This is Aditya!

Apart from _coffee_, anthying which relates to _"Nanotechnology with Space propulsion/Space research"_ excites me on delving more into the same. Majored as a **ChemE Undergrad**, my _current research_ involves areas pertinent to: 

  💡 **Computational Nanotechnology and Classical CFD.**

  💡 **Multiphase Flows largely based on evaporation-condensation heat transfer in Air-breathing Engines.** 
  
  💡 **Turbulence Reacting Flows (Turbulence Modelling).**   
 
  💡 **Compressible Flows with Low mach, Gas-Liquid Flows, Computational Heat Transfer, Supersonic and Hypersonic Flows.** 
  
  💡 **High-fidelity DNS using Low reynolds numbers.**
  
  💡 **MD Simulations largely using Kinetic Monte Carlo method assisted with some "py" packages.**
  
Languages (Computing): **MATLAB**,**Python**, **C** _and_ **C++**. 

Environments: **Linux Bash**, **Ubuntu**, **OpenFOAM** _and_ **GIT**. 
  
Packages: **ANSYS Workbench**, **ANSYS Fluent**, **ANSYS Mechanical**, **CFD-Post**, **Paraview** and **Tecplot** for _Processing and Simulations_. Also, **OriginPro** and **Aspen Hysys Plus V11.0** for _Plant Designing and Data Assimilation_.
  
HPC Tools: **OpenMP** and **CUDA (GPU)/MPI** 
  
ML Packages: **SciML**, **Deep Learning (DL)** and **Physics Informed Neural Networks (PINNs)**. Also learning **Deep Text Mining** for creating up a _linked database_ to store _research articles, arXiv publications_ and _citational articles_.
  
**A Fun fact about me**: _A crazy cusp of Low-fi and Acoustic music with a bibliophilic sway._
