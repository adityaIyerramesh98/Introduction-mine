# Hello There 👋🏼 

This is Aditya Iyer Ramesh, I know that sounds like a pretty strechy name, but yeah you can call me **"Aditya"**!!

Am a ChemE Undergrad and my current research involves in areas pertinent to: 

  💡 Computational Nanotechnology, Effect of Nanofluids inside HXs using ANSYS.

  💡 Turbulence Reacting  and Shear Flows (Turbulence Modelling), Multiphase Flows and High Schmidt Number Scalar Mixing.   
 
  💡 Compressible Flows, Gas-Liquid Flows, Gas-Particle Flows and Subsonic and Supersonic Noise Simulations (A Retrospective Analysis). 
  
  💡 MD Simulations using KMC Method, Chemical Reaction Engineering and Kinetic Theory.
  
  💡 LES and DNS with low mach and reynold numbers including small scales, FEA using Fluid Mechanics. 
  
Possessing good working knowledge on wet research with utilization of Softwares and Packages including:

  💡 MATLAB, Python, C, C++ and Runtime Environments like Linux, Ubuntu and Java.
  
  💡 OpenFOAM, ANSYS Workbench, ANSYS Fluent, ANSYS Mechanical for Pre-Processing and CFD-Post, Paraview for Post-Processing.
  
  💡 OriginPro and Aspen Hysys Plus V11.0 for Data Processing and PFD Designing.
  
Learning HPC and ML Packages which would be implemented in due course of time, entails:

  💡 OpenMPI, CUDA (GPU) and Massively Parallel Computations (Falling short of a SP, ready for intern)
  
  💡 SciML, Deep Neural Networks (DNNs), Convolution Neural Networks (CNNs), Physics Informed Neural Networks (PINNs), Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Variational Auto Encoders (VAEs) and Bayesian Statistics.
  
  💡 Deep Text Mining for creating up a linked database to store research articles, arXiv publications and citational artcles.  

**QUICK UPDATE:** A separate _site hosting_ (portfolio) is in the pipeline. I'll paste the URL here, as soon as I build that and automate the same using git clones.
